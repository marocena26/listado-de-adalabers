#### Render the list of Adalabers

- Paint a **header** with a title that reads **Adalabers**.
- **Render** the initial **list of Adalabers**. To do this we provide you with the data in the following [API](https://beta.adalab.es/curso-intensivo-fullstack-recursos/apis/adalabers-v1/promo-radsajsd.json).

#### Add a new Adalaber

To **add the data** of a new partner we will follow these steps steps:
- **Create a form** with the following fields:
  - Name of the **classmate**
  - Name of her **tutor**
  - **Speciality** in which she excels
  - A **button to Add** a new Adalaber.
- When the user **clicks on the button**, the **Adalaber** must be **added to the list** of pupils so that it appears in the table.

#### Filter the list of Adalabers (BONUS)

We will filter the pupils in two different ways: 

- **By name**: Through a `<input>` of text type: the **list** of Adalabers will be render showing only those whose **name includes the text written** by the user.
- **By tutor**: Through a `<select>`. This select placed in the header will have the following options:
  - Cualquiera (es la opci√≥n por defecto)
  - Yanelis
  - Dayana
  - Iv√°n

When the user changes this `<select>`, the **list** of Adalabers will be render **showing only those that match the selected option**.


#### Add social networks (BONUS)

A fourth column will be added to our table with links to the social networks each Adalaber has social networks that each Adalaber has.

2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.

Once you have **done the fork**:

1. Open it in your code editor.
2. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

npm install node-sass
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:
